# Algorithmns
Several Algorithmns that be used in the course work, all build by my own

# Method:
1. Bucket_Sort: Arrange the name with alphabet order.
2. DFS: checking all the course, and will generate a list with all courses and their prerequests
3. Dijkstra: find the shortest path to every other vertex
4. Max_Extract: using Max heapfy algorithms to create the order for a tree.
5. Finite_automata: find same pattern of two strings.
6. huff_tree: find the path from the largest to smallest number.
7. Johnson: find all pairs shortest paths in a graph.
8. Undirected_graph_Addable_vertex: use bellman, huff_tree, Johnson, to find the shortest path between two vertexes in a graph.
# Knowledge:
  Different kinds of Sorting/Graph Algorithmns.
# Hardest part:
  In the Undirected_graph project, it is hard to have perfect linkage between different algorithmns.
