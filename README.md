# Algorithmns
Several Algorithmns that be used in the course work, all build by my own

# Method:
	Bucket_Sort: Arrange the name with alphabet order.
	DFS: checking all the course, and will generate a list with all courses and their prerequests
	Dijkstra: find the shortest path to every other vertex
	Max_Extract: using Max heapfy algorithms to create the order for a tree.
	Finite_automata: find same pattern of two strings.
	huff_tree: find the path from the largest to smallest number.
	Johnson: find all pairs shortest paths in a graph.
	Undirected_graph_Addable_vertex: use bellman, huff_tree, Johnson, to find the shortest path between two vertexes in a graph.
# Knowledge:
	Different kinds of Sorting/Graph Algorithmns.
# Hardest part:
	In the Undirected_graph project, it is hard to have perfect linkage between different algorithmns.
